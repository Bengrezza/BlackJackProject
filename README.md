## Description

This program simulates a simple version of BlackJack. The functionality of the game is below:

1.) It has an Object Oriented class structure.

2.) When the game begins both the player and dealer are dealt two cards.

3.) If a player or dealer is dealt 21 the game is over. Otherwise the player can choose to hit as many times as they wish until they choose to stay.

4.) Once the player has completed their turn the dealer will begin their turn, automatically hitting or staying according to the Blackjack rules.

5.) The game is immediately over if either player gets above 21.

6.) The winner is displayed.

## Technologies Used
1.) Java
2.) Eclipse
3.) Git

## Lessons Learned

This project helped me better grasp the capabilities of Object-Oriented Programming. It helped me learn the below:

1.) Getting comfortable building classes in an Object-Oriented manner.
2.) Building classes whose fields are Objects.
3.) Practice writing methods.
4.) Use collection types to organize and manage data.
5.) Use conditionals to create game logic.
